1. There were different CVD rates between groups. Group A had 0.319 which was lower than the control and Treatment B. Treatment A is most effective for reducing cardiovascular risk.
2. Treatment B had the highest adherence %, they followed the program the best, but did not have the lowest rate of cvd. Therefore the treatment was more effective than following the plan longer.
3. The control group had the worst cvd outcomes, meaning the treatment itself had an effect, not just following the plan
